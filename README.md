# labday2017-chrome-tablets
Project proposal for _Datascience lab day 2017_

## Slugline
Tablets to cure the anxiety with closing tabs, bookmarking like a maniac and getting lost in browser history

A chrome-plugin to auto archive based on related subject.

Because online search is a large part of what we do as makers of code. We troubleshoot, look at documentation. 
The average developer I know has a lot of tabs open, sometimes for days. 
To keep this organised eats up some  cognitive space. Its organised around “session” or “subjects”.

## Goals

1. Remove the anxiety with closing tabs and to forget information that one gathered. The need to bookmark even!

# Means
create a browser plugin that keeps history organised in some way that I can look back on. Filteres out the personal noise.
Archive the links to a app running on google cloud, or add a page in chrome to keep data local. 
Add some machine learning algorithms to keep the links relavant to this person and the browsing behaviour. 

## Requirements

* Have an editor with syntax support elm / javascript
